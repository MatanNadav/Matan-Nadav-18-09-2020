# Weather app

Weather app i was assign to do.
This project uses React CLI, React-Redux with Hooks.
I wanted to build this app using the latest best practices regarding the use of Redux & Hooks and building it made me a lot better
at React in general and Redux in particular.

I tried keeping the dependecies to a minimum.

## Project setup
npm i to instal the dependecies.

This app launched on default React port - 3000 and the server is listening on 8080.

## Important:
I had to use a particular API that doesnt allow more than 50 calls per day so there will be times when the app wont display current weather.
